                    <p class="mt0">AAG is one of the largest privately held dealership management corporations in the
                        USA. I
                        designed
                        and
                        developed OEM compliant websites, landing pages, emails, display, social, and search engine ads
                        for
                        BMW,
                        Dodge, Cadillac, Honda, Hyundai, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, Mini, Nissan, Porsche, and Volvo.</p>
                    <p class="mt0">I would start projects by analyzing the request sent to us by the account executives,
                        and respond
                        directly to them or with OEM compliance with any questions or additional information about the
                        target
                        audience, or goals of their campaigns.</p>
                    <p class="mt0">Phalanx is a custom WordPress system built in PHP that generated these HMTL, CSS, and
                        Javascript
                        assets.
                        It
                        also
                        functioned as a job management, staff performance reporting, budget reporting, and client
                        relationship
                        management system. We saw asset production time and performance increases across the board from
                        200
                        to
                        400%.

                    <p class="mt0">Sometimes they would want to use an existing template, or one from another sister
                        dealership, and
                        we
                        would
                        either design and code from scratch if that solution didn’t truly align with their goals, or
                        modify
                        their
                        template if it did.</p>
                    <p class="mt0">I noticed this caused a lot of problems as many of the webpages, ads and email
                        campaigns weren’t
                        properly
                        litmus, cross browser tested, or designed based on performance analytics from Google or our
                        email
                        marketing
                        performance metrics. These oversights cost our clients performance loss, as assets would either
                        break or
                        not
                        be optimized.</p>

                    <p class="mt0">As a solution I designed and pitched Phalanx. I worked with the SEO, email, ad, AV,
                        media buyer,
                        account
                        executive and management teams to collect and analyze performance metrics available from Google
                        Analytics,
                        Visual Web Optimizer, Campaigner (email), and Job management systems to determine which assets
                        are
                        the
                        highest performing and why.</p>
                    <p class="mt0">Using this information, I built Phalanx to generate website assets, emails, ads, and
                        landing
                        pages
                        that
                        were
                        optimized by data for performance, and upon frameworks that work across all browsers and email
                        clients.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt0">I did this by first analyzing the data from our analytics tools, wire framing,
                        prototyping, user,
                        browser,
                        and
                        litmus testing, adjusting and developing the approved and highest performing assets.</p>
