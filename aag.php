                        USA. After acquisition of a dealership, our department would provide them with all of their
                        digital marketing solutions. From websites, email campaigns, display ads, social ads, search

                    <h2>Research &amp; Testing</h2>
                    <p class="mt0">I would start web, email and ad design projects by analyzing the request sent to us
                        by the account executives, and respond directly to them or with OEM compliance with any
                        questions or additional information about the target audience, or goals of their campaigns.
                        After completion we would look at Google Analytics, Visual Web Optimizer, heat mapping and
                        Campaigner (email) analytics to see what was and was not working, we would create a hypothesis,
                        update the assets and template, and review the findings, keeping what worked, and eliminating
                        what did not.</p>
                    <p class="mt0">In example, one of our biggest such projects was the vehicle search modules included
                        as the first, and dominant element on their homepages. Looking at the heat mapping and
                        interaction metrics from Google Analytics we were able to determine that there were two primary
                        user groups with the same goal of locating a vehicle but with different approaches. Some already
                        had an idea of the exact make and model that they wanted, while others only had a vague idea. We
                        implemented and A/B tested variants that allowed drop down selection for year, make, and model,
                        another that had clickable images that indicated make and model (sedan, convertible, SUV, etc,),
                        and a final variant that had both. </p>
                    <p class="mt0">I designed and executed user tests for Phalanx directly with all departments. I’d
                        have them walk me through how they used the system on a daily basis, show me any pain points on
                        their paths. This gave me insights into their natural unguided usage. I also designed a few
                        tasks for them to complete so that I could see if my designed user paths were in line with their
                        actual goals.</p>

                    <h2>Design &amp; Development</h2>
                    <p class="mt0">After collecting the goals and requirements from our clients or account executives,
                        we would either create a new site, page, ad, or email campaign from scratch if the request was
                        highly custom, or utilize a highly performing template as a boilerplate. High fidelity mock-ups
                        and designs were created, passed through OEM compliance and the client for approval, and then
                        built in Phalanx. If an asset was highly custom we would create this from scratch, but Phalanx
                        performed at least 90% of the assets.</p>
                    <p class="mt0">I noticed this caused a lot of problems as many of the webpages, ads and email
                        campaigns weren’t properly litmus, cross browser tested, or designed based on performance
                        analytics from Google or our email marketing performance metrics. These oversights cost our
                        clients performance loss, as assets would either break or not be optimized. As a solution I
                        designed and pitched Phalanx, a custom WordPress site that generated these assets. These website
                        assets, emails, ads, and landing pages that were designed and optimized by data from Google
                        Analytics, heat mapping, Visual Web Optimizer, and Campaigner for performance, and upon
                        frameworks that work across all browsers and email clients.</p>
                    <p class="mt0">Phalanx also functioned as a job management, staff performance reporting, budget
                        reporting, and client relationship management system. I build it as a custom theme with custom
                        plugins in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and PHP. I worked with the SEO, email, ad,
                        AV, media buyer, account executive and management teams to collect and analyze performance.</p>
