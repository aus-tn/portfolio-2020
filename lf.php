                        international sustainable fabrics company They needed a new e-commerce presence that catered to

                        alternative to normal bedding via a eucalyptus fibered alternative, sold on an ecommerce model.

                    <h2>Research &amp; Testing</h2>
                    <p class="mt0">Google Analytics was the first tool I set up to gain insights into our users. The
                        first insight I gained was regarding our demographic. It seemed that middle aged women made up
                        over 80% of our user base. They were purchasing for themselves primarily however, gift sales
                        occurred about 30% of the time, we later leveraged this data to further improve the gift process
                        via adding more dominant and easier to use gift code usage and hoisting gift purchase
                        promotionals on the homepage and in other promotional materials. </p>
                    <p class="mt0">I pitched UX testing to leadership, however they felt it was too early to invest in,
                        to still get user feedback we interviewed and collected surveys from our most loyal and local
                        customers. There were also office tours that occured in the building we shared with Valley Forge
                        Fabrics, and we would take advantage of collecting their feedback as well.</p>

                    <p class="mt0">
                        First I collected all the product data, so I could organize and prioritize the products, their
                        meta, and their categories. I then collected all the content provided by marketing, minimized
                        and organized it. Using new information architecture, I mapped it to a site map and wireframe of
                        each of the pages, for approval of the VP.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt0">After approval of the IA and wireframes, I created labeled and detailed high fidelity
                        mock-ups, fleshed out with imagery, coloring, typography, and glyphicons. The details included
                        broke down why things were placed where they were and why they were styled a certain way. This
                        increased the understanding of the stakeholders.</p>
                    <p class="mt0">
                        After approval of the high-fidelity mock-ups, I researched popular keywords and injected them
                        into the site, as well as setup of Google Webmaster, and other search engine registrations.
                        Plugins were installed to check and optimize SEO as we built. I designed and built the new site
                        upon Shopify using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Liquid. I also designed and
                        built the email campaigns using the Mailchimp framework. I also designed banners, display ads,
                        and social media graphics in Photoshop, and Illustrator.
