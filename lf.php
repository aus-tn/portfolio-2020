                    <p class="mt0">Living fresh is the residential e-commerce branch of Valley Forge Fabrics, an
                        international sustainable fabrics company
                        They needed a new e-commerce presence that catered to families and individuals. We wanted to
                        provide a luxurious, sustainable, and allergy friendly alternative to normal bedding via a
                        eucalyptus fibered alternative.</p>
                    <p class="mt0">
                        Communicating this involved soft organic coloring, and professional photography in luxurious
                        lighting and settings. This feeling of luxury and sustainability was carried through in the font
                        choice and inclusion of gratuitous negative space.</p>

                        cater to our target market.</p>

                        I designed and built the new site upon Shopify. I also worked with our graphic designer and
                        photographer to build the brand standards and logo. I worked directly under the VP so the
                        wire-framing, prototyping, and site build was able to be revised and approved rapidly.
