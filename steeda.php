                        Steeda is one of the largest Ford performance parts manufacturers in the world. They needed to
                        reinvent itself after unfortunately suffering a cyber attack under the web master before me.
                        Working directly under the CEO, and on site where customers would bring in their cars for
                        upgrades, and where we housed the custom build Steeda cars, I was able to directly interview and
                        research the stakeholders and the end users.

                    <p class="mt0">I redesigned and rebuilt their four major e-commerce sites. One for Ford Mustang
                        parts, the other three for Focus, Fiesta, and Fusion. We kept the logo and I utilized their blue
                        (good for signaling reliability) to inspire the complimentary orange to direct users attention
                        across the sites.</p>
                    <p class="mt0">
                        The information hierarchy was built upon the most popular parts reported by Google Analytics.
                        The navigation and sub navigation then mirrored the existing categorization of parts, which was
                        built and tried and true from their previous sites and marketing materials. This kept the new
                        sites architecture consistent for users to have an easy time using the new sites.</p>

                        and existing product images. I also requested they used a light box and had one of our
                        photographers work to replace existing images that were used without this method, this improved
                        the consistency of imagery and increased the online sales of products that switched to the new
                        photography method.</p>

                        Steeda was rebuilt on the existing CS Cart CMS for time, but after research of other available
                        platforms that integrated with our existing ecosystem of other business systems, I recommended
                        we move to 3d Cart, one approved the design was moved to the new platform.</p>
