                    Steeda is one of the largest Ford performance parts manufacturers in the world. They desired to
                    re-invent themselves as their current online presence faced poor performance and down-time. They
                    had four major ecommerce sites, each providing parts for Mustang, Focus, Fusion, and Fieta Ford
                    models.

                    with a prominent call to action.</p>

                    attention but doesn't interupt the users visual flow, or scream for attention while browsing.

                <h2>Research &amp; Testing</h2>
                <p class="mt0">Google Analytics was invaluable in helping determine the most popular vehicles,
                    makes, models, years and parts for each. This helped me build the information architecture for
                    the products, including which meta is most important, their categorization, their hierarchy and
                    their individual promotion positions on the pages. A/B testing the new site against the previous
                    one in Google Analytics was one of my main points of data that drove the optimization of the
                    site.</p>
                <p class="mt0">
                    Working directly under the CEO, and on a site where customers would bring in their cars for
                    upgrades, and where we housed the custom built Steeda cars, I was able to directly interact with
                    the end users, getting a feel for their personality types, making user profiles an easy task. It
                    also made creating user flows and paths much easier. I also installed feedback plugins and
                    collected feedback from the sales team. </p>

                <h2>Design &amp; Development</h2>
                <p class="mt0">The information hierarchy was built upon the most popular parts reported by Google
                    Analytics. The navigation and sub navigation then mirrored the categorization of parts (starting
                    at model, then to year, category, then sub-category), The users were almost always car
                    enthusiasts who knew exactly what they wanted so the mission was to help direct them to what
                    they were looking for. This navigation style catered to this, and the search bar included on the
                    sticky header picked up any slack, and provided shortcuts to get the users to their parts
                    faster.</p>
                <p class="mt0">
                    The most popular parts were always hoisted to the top of pages, descriptions, links to and CTAs
                    were designed to be as apparent as possible to help steer the repeat customers, and customers
                    who came to learn about the best offerings from Steeda. Imagery from their events was included
                    in a lot of the hero portions of pages to promote our most loyal community members, and raise
                    awareness of such events.</p>
                <p class="mt0">Leveraging feedback and data from the new analytics and feedback tools, I was able to
                    reduce and streamline the checkout process. We integrated a one page checkout, and added new
                    promotional code sections which we also included to specific user groups via targeted
                    advertising. We saw increases in user satisfaction, goal completion, and uptime across the
                    board.</p>
